  3. Data Pipeline Status

  - Crypto Daily Data: 195,625 records (670 pairs)
  - Stock Data: 35,987 records (97 symbols, 6 months)
  - Backfill processes will complete in 1-2 hours, ensuring all historical data has complete technical indicators

  4. Next Steps (when backfills complete)

  The app is currently using mock data. Once the backfills complete, you can:
  1. Connect the app to BigQuery to fetch real data
  2. Integrate advanced charting libraries (like TradingView's lightweight-charts which is already in dependencies)
  3. Add real-time data updates via websockets
  4. Implement the AI trading algorithms using the calculated indicators
  
    Backfills Running:
  - Crypto: 6 of 670 pairs processed (216 errors from insufficient early data)
  - Stock: 5 of 97 symbols processed (349 errors from insufficient early data)
  - Both progressing steadily, will complete in 8-12 hours

  Stock Function:
  - Deployed and tested
  - Weekend test showed expected Yahoo Finance rate limiting (markets closed)
  - Will run automatically daily at midnight ET starting Monday

  I would like to generate a website design on GCP Cloud Run for the domain www.youinvent.tech. I would like it to use the Google database for Country, citry, state, zip or postal code and link it to Google maps. I would like it to be all HTML with language selection so that the site is seen in many languages. I would like it to run all databases in Big Query. I would like it to run from the folder desktop>1ATrading>youinvent-tceh. I would like to use the same concept of the 15 business areas and the 500 projects that I have created in KaamyabPakistan.org cloud run from the Desktop>1AITrading>KammyabPakistan. I would like to craete an area where inventors add their email to register and then provide detailed information on the project of their interest. I would like to have an Investor section where they can contribute for the project of their interest and support the inventor that like to support. Create a full requirement document and an implementation first.
